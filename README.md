# ToolchainManager

Do You have multiple toolchains with similar executable name, like `clang` for multiple targets or multiple versions?

Hate to always edit the PATH environment variable when there is a need to change target or version?

ToolchainManager solves this problem.

Download it, and give it a go.

See the `tcmgr_user_guide.md` for documentation about usage.
